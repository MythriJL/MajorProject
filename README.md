# Major Project 

## ABSTRACT
The recent developments of deep learning support the identification and classification of lung diseases in medical images. Hence, numerous works on the detection of lung disease using deep learning can be found in the literature. This project presents a survey of deep learning for lung disease detection in medical images. There has only been one survey paper published in the last five years regarding deep learning directed at lung disease detection. However, their survey is lacking in the presentation of taxonomy and analysis of the trend of recent work. The objectives of this project are to present a taxonomy of the state-of-the-art deep learning-based lung disease detection systems, visualize the trends of recent work on the domain and identify the remaining issues and potential future directions in this domain. The taxonomy consists of seven attributes that are common in the surveyed articles: image types, features, data augmentation, types of deep learning algorithms, transfer learning, the ensemble of classifiers, and types of lung diseases. The potential future direction suggested could further improve the efficiency and increase the number of deep learning-aided lung disease detection applications.
